Project created to check the best way to integrate a pattern library and website independent modules.

### Pattern Library

The pattern library project is a group of reusable components that you can see and interact thanks to Storybook.\
The folders are organized using atomic design and, for the styles, Tailwind CSS is used.

The website project use the NextJS framework and integrate the components created in the pattern library.

One of the best ways to learn and improve is by sharing knowledge, so you can use this project to study and improve. I hope you find it useful!
